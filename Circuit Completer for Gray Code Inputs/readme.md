PROJECT DESCRIPTION

  This program completes a circuit by choosing the gates that fill the circuit and fulfill the constraints with the input permutations, the ordering of multiplexer and the decoders being in Gray Code. I chose gates based on a DFS strategy where each gate was temporarily designated as a logic gate, chosen in the order of the gates (OR, AND, XOR, NOT, DECODER, MULTIPLEXER).
